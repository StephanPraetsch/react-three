# red gitlab pipeline

```bash
yarn react-scripts test
```
then press `a` results in
```text
    SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module

      1 | import * as THREE from 'three';
    > 2 | import {OrbitControls} from 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
```
couldn't resolve this so far.
